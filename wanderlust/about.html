        <br>*Wanderlust is a strong desire or impulse to travel and explore
        the world. The word originates from German — "wandern" (to hike 
        or roam) and "Lust" (desire or pleasure). </p><p>*It captures that deep, 
        often restless urge to seek out new places, experiences, and
